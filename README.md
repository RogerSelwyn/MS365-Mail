# Microsoft 365 To Do Integration for Home Assistant

This integration enables:
1. Getting, creating and updating MS To Do Lists

This project would not be possible without the wonderful [python-o365 project](https://github.com/O365/python-o365).

## [Buy Me A Beer üçª](https://buymeacoffee.com/rogtp)
I work on this integration because I like things to work well for myself and others. Whilst I have now made significant changes to the integration, it would not be as it stands today without the major work to create it put in by @PTST. Please don't feel you are obligated to donate, but of course it is appreciated.
